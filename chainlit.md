# 🌍 Welcome to the Chainlit Travel Planner! ✈️

Ready to build your perfect itinerary? I'm here to help you plan a personalized and memorable trip.  
Just share a few quick details to get started — or dive right in if you already have a destination in mind!

Here are some things you can tell me:
- **Who** you’re traveling with (solo, partner, family, friends)
- **Where** you’d like to go
- **How long** you plan to stay or your travel dates
- **What kind of activities** you’re interested in (e.g., food, culture, beach, hiking, nightlife)

The more you share, the better your itinerary will be!

🧭 Let’s get started whenever you’re ready.
